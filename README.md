# Abandonment to Divine Providence
A succinct, spiritual manuscript consisting of 54 short meditations,
designed to help usher you gently into living your life in the moment
to fulfill your purpose in life.

Read an [excerpt](doc/excerpt.pdf) of the short, sweet, portable pocket version.

The (much) longer, heavier, hardcover study version is under development.
